It determines the complexity of the language and concepts you can use.

Adjust your language to match the audience’s expertise level.
Provide background information to help them understand the relevance of the information for the les technical audience.
Provide summaries for those who need just an overview, and more detailed sections for those interested in specifics.


## 3. How can you gauge the existing knowledge of your audience to avoid overwhelming them with jargon?

Before creating content, gather information through surveys or direct communication.
Begin with basic concepts and gradually introduce more complex ideas.

Examples and real-world scenarios help illustrate abstract concepts.

Flowcharts: For processes and workflows.
